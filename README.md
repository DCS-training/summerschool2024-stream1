# CDCS Summer School 2024
## A Gentle Introduction to Coding for Data Analysis

This is a repository for all the materials for Stream 1 of the CDCS 2024 summer school. This repository is currently in a maintenance phase before the start of the summer school and will be ready for public viewing by 07/06/2024. For current queries, please message Chris Oldnall through the newly established Teams channel.

## Welcome.

This course is designed for researchers who are complete beginners with no prior knowledge of coding and data analysis. Through lectures and exercises, attendees will learn how to code in Python, starting from core concepts such as variables and loops, through to coding live data visualisation. The course explores the basics of programming: variables, functions, loops, operating on data structures, data wrangling and visualisation. By the end of the summer school, attendees will understand how to bridge the gap between humans and computers, and how to apply the skills they have learnt to their own data analysis and research.

## How to use Noteable.

Throughout this course we will be using the [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/) platform to run Jupyter notebooks. This is a cloud-based computational notebook system that work on your browser from any device.

#### Start Noteable
1.  Open the following link in a new tab:  [https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login).
2.  Login with your EASE credentials (either your Edinburgh university login, or those you were provided with).
3.  Under 'Standard Notebook (Python 3)' click 'Start'
   
#### Download the files to Noteable.
1.  From the Noteable home page, click on the '+GitRepo' button at the top right of the screen.
2.  In the 'Git Repository URL' field copy the link to this GitHub repository, "https://github.com/DCS-training/summerschool2024-stream1". Ignore all other fields.
3.  Once filled in, click the 'clone' button. After a few moments, you will then see a new folder appear with the files.
